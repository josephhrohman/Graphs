### At a Glance:
*The graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of two elements:*
- ***NODES** : A set of data points*
- ***EDGES** : The connections between the data points*
*While non-linear, graphs can exist as directed and undirected data structures where :*

### Directed Vs Undirected
![Le Graph Charts](img/direction_graphs.png)
<br />*Think one-way flight vs round-trip.
- *Directed:   **Node(A) -----> Node(B)** (A) is connected to (B), however (B) is **NOT** connected to (A)*
- *Undirected: **Node(B) <----> Node(C)** : (B) is connected to (C) **AND** (C) is connected to (B)*

### Examples of Graph Implementation:
Facebook Like & Comment
Facebook Search for Friend (breadth vs depth)

### Why Graphs are Useful:
Graphs are eeeeverywhere.
